# ultimate-kotlin
Library of common Kotlin functionality

TODO:
- In common-js, use https://www.fritz2.dev/

Ideas for projects:
- Don't build an apartment management system, nor a property management system. Perhaps, just a management system is needed. And, maybe a plugin for maintenance requests or the ability to handle money. Could show apartment units, houses, pizza, or parks, etc.
